title: How to Transform Samsung
---

While working as a vice president of the Mobile Division of Samsung Electronics, which is a giant mobile phone manufacturer of South Korea since June 2015, I learn that several cultural assumptions that I had were incorrect. While running to the incompatibility between my assumptions and the reality, I think that maybe the approaches to change this organization should be somewhat different. Instead of merely applying research and collected widsdom in western world (mainly in the United States), I need to better understand the cultural context and figure out the best approach to make this organization healthy and effective. I have not had any industrial experiences prior to Samsung, so the findings that I have might not be pecularity of Samsung - commonality of the whole industry. However, instead judging it based on my limited experiences, I would rather share my experiences, and I hope that readers with different background could provide their perspectives.

I would like to describe what I have observed and experiemented so far, and hopefully glean out some insights from this.

- Strong tendency toward certainty

Many employees requires certainty in their jobs and roles. 

- Weak documentation

Though Samsung has infrastructure of various documentation systems (e.g., wiki, community building site), it is surprising to see that overall quality of existing documentations is very low. I do not know if this is originated from the secretive culture to defend the organization from pontential lawsuit. Anyhow, it is quite challenging as a novice member to learn from established documentation or guidelines to navigate through the organization. Knowledge acquisition is primarily done through human network. Because of this nature, it is quite important to have the Korean language skill and being to able to discern singals from noise. Because of political tension between people, learning political dynamics is quite handy to understand the nuance of different communication. However, getting involved with the political turmoil does not seem to be wise because it could shut off information from one party.

I have tried to promote knowledge accumulation through internal wiki. However, as
