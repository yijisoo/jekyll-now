Understanding natural language by human being would

1. Definition of understanding

It is interesting to note that the majority of work in the field of natural language understanding boils down to tokenize or parse the natural language into computer processable units or pre-defined slots. It would be necessary to define what "understanding" is in the context of "natural language understanding." Like the definition of artificial intelligence, it might be depending on the goal of a system or agent. If the goal of the agent is simply responding to a human agent's natural language and replying back to the agent out of a limited set of responses, simple domain classifier with some slot filling would be sufficient. If the accuracy of the response is above the predefined threshold or surpass the expectation of the commisioners of the agent, the designer of the artificial agent successfullly achieves the goal. Thus, one can say that the agent understands natural language to some extend.

However, is it really the criteria to use? Are there any fundamental aspects of defining "dedetersanding?" this is what I want to achieve from this article.
