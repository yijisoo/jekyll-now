# Introduction

The book starts with the following excerpt, which is very true to me. I experiences lots of stressful moments, which have led me to obssess with more distraciton, which turns out to be more destructive.

> "Most people don’t want to acknowledge the uncomfortable truth that distraction is always an unhealthy escape from reality." [reference][1]

One thing that we need to do is finidng fun out of our work.

In addition, the attitude toward the willpower is one of strong indicators on how a person can resist to a craving or not.

Timeboxing is a technique to determine on what kinds of things to do for a given time slot, so that I have a plan in using my own time. Anything other than that task is distraction. The timeboxed thing doesn't need to be a work. It could be a nap, watching a TV, and running around. As long as I do as I planned, I am not distracted.

It is very important to have a long term friendship. The idea that the author suggested was having kibbutz, which in Hebrew means "gathering." I really like this idea, but I wonder how I can gather these friends. Maybe the 인절미 group could be a candidate. However, we don't get together that often.

Syncing my weekly schedule with my boss would be an interesting idea. I might need to try this idea with ES, so that he can understand what kinds of energy I spend.

Around the pages around external trigger, this book became less insightful, and became more like tips and tricks to prevent you from various distraction (e.g., unnecessary meetings and attenting-grabbing mobile apps). These tips are surely useful (e.g., getting rid of unused apps), but not sure if they are the fundamental stuff. A more fundamental recommendation could be more like "build your surrounding environment less distracting." Your devices, apps, meetings are some physical / non-physical artifacts around you, which consumer your attention. I always go back to only verbage from Hebbert Simon, one of my all time heroes, who said, "In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it."

Oh, the idea of controling the external evironments is actually shown in Chapter 22, "the power of precommitments"

The idea of using identity pact to be an inidstractable is quite interesting.

Ritual. I might need a daily ritual to make myself more focused person.

One thing that I found refreshing is that other succesful people also experience the same problem.
