I started to read this book, but the progress has been quite slow. I read that Design Thinking is not a simple recipe, but a philosophy and a set of tools. However, one thing that strikes my mind is whether the difficulty comes from what is the most important has not been effectively taught. The process of having empathy and generating insights does not seem to be well documented. Yes, every problem can be different and unique. However, if a process / a group of people can provide a better technique or perspective than others, that particular approach should have a distinctive approach. Maybe, it is the abduction that Roger Martin mentioned in his book, the Design of Business. Then, the abduction should be properly taught.

Well, do I know design thinking? I don't think so. I haven't have any good example of outcomes that I personally generate through design thinking. I think that I need to do it by myself.

I also found that the author doesn't believe in user-generated contents. It is somewhat odd that many software projects are now open sources. Thus, I wonder why the author has such a view.

I get that insights are not the results of analytic thinking. However, it is good to know that they may come more often to the prepared minds. "Certain themes and variations--techniques of observations, principles of empathy, and efforts to move beyond the individuals" might be the clue to push the people in the boundary.

However, I wonder if we think of anything "move beyond the indviduals." This idea should be considered as well.

The idea of divergent and promoting experiments was emphasized in the book, but I don't know whether we have the culture of accepting these yet. Culturally, we are too risk averse, which made people think that unsuccessful projects are wasteful. I need to demonstrate in the meeting that the seemingly wasteful projects actually turned out to be the successful project.

One of the key ideas was to continue different experiments toward the better results. I don't know whether they experienced these or not. I am not super happy with the current outcomes, but I cannot continuously push without the direction.

Reading a book is often providing stimuli to me to think about my mistakes. I just read about making the organization positive and optimistic. Yes, it is obvious, but when I just criticized my group last week, and it made me feel guilty on what I just did. I think that it is important to have sufficient sleep so that I can control my temper. Without sufficient sleep, I reveal my uncontroled frustration easily.

I don't know what would be the most effective way to prototype our phones. The form factor, unless we go to the direction of a completely crazy shape, is likely a usual bar or foldables. Then, what else do we have to prototype? Software side is relatively easy. However, is that all?
