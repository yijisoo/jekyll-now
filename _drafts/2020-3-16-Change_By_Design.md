I started to read this book, but the progress has been quite slow. I read that Design Thinking is not a simple recipe, but a philosophy and a set of tools. However, one thing that strikes my mind is whether the difficulty comes from what is the most important has not been effectively taught. The process of having empathy and generating insights does not seem to be well documented. Yes, every problem can be different and unique. However, if a process / a group of people can provide a better technique or perspective than others, that particular approach should have a distinctive approach. Maybe, it is the abduction that Roger Martin mentioned in his book, the Design of Business. Then, the abduction should be properly taught.

Well, do I know design thinking? I don't think so. I haven't have any good example of outcomes that I personally generate through design thinking. I think that I need to do it by myself.
